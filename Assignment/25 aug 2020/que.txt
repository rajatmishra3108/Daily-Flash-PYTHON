For a given integer 'n', consider the integers from 0 upto n (including 0 & n). Find sum and average of even and odd numbers separately for the integers considered.
Then print the average and sum values in ascending order on separate lines. (Averages on first line and sums on second line separated by a space)
If sum or average values for both even and odd are equal, only print it once.
If any of the 4 required values cannot be calculated print 'INVALID INPUT'.
Input Format

A single integer 'n' will be given as input.

Constraints

n <= 10000

Output Format

Output will contain maximum two lines. One if the input is invalid. Each line can contain maximum of two values separated by a single space.
Print averages on first line and sums on second line separated by a space.
!!!NOTE : NOT EVEN EXTRA SPACE IS ALLOWED AS IT MIGHT RESULT IN WRONG ANSWER!!!
Sample Input 0

10
Sample Output 0

5.0
25 30
Explanation 0

Ex : n = 10
Considered numbers : 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Sum of even numbers se = 30
Sum of odd numbers so = 25
Average of even numbers ae = 5.0
Average of odd numbers ao = 5.0

Here avg of even = avg of odd, thus print it only once

Sum of odd < sum of even, thus print sum of odd numbers first and print the sum of even numbers (ascending order)
Sample Input 1

-2
Sample Output 1

-1.0
-2 -1
Explanation 1

n = -2
Considered numbers = 0, -1, -2
Sum of even numbers = -2
Sum of odd numbers = -1
Average of even numbers ae = -1.0
Average of odd numbers ao = -1.0

Here average is same for odd and even numbers thus print it only once

Sum of even < sum of odd, thus print sum of even numbers first and then print the sum of odd numbers (ascending order)
