For the given input range (n1 - n2) find the even and odd numbers present in the range inclusive of the end points of the range. Find the sum of the even numbers and odd numbers respectively.
If the sum of even numbers is more than the sum of odd numbers then print the even numbers that are in the given range according to the following rules :
Each row can contain at max 5 numbers.
Numbers in a row must be separated by a space.
If sum of odd numbers is more do the same for odd numbers in the given range.
If the given range is invalid print 'INVALID RANGE'. A range can be invalid if starting and ending value is the same or if the starting value is greater than the ending value.
Input Format

Two numbers will be given as input on a separate lines that denote the starting and ending value of the range respectively.

Constraints

n1, n2 <= 10000

Output Format

Output may contain a matrix which can have at max 5 elements in each row (the last row may contain different number of elements than the other rows) or it should print a string denoting invalid range.

Sample Input 0

100
111
Sample Output 0

101 103 105 107 109
111
Explanation 0

Even numbers in the range : 100, 102, 104, 106, 108, 110
Sum of even numbers : 100 + 102 + 104 + 106 + 108 + 110 = 630
Odd numbers in the range : 101, 103, 105, 107, 109, 111
Sum of odd numbers : 101 + 103 + 105 + 107 + 109 + 111 = 636
Thus, SUM(Odd) > SUM(Even)
Output :
101 103 105 107 109
111
Sample Input 1

18
Sample Output 1

0 2 4 6 8
10 12 14 16 18
Explanation 1

Even numbers in the range : 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18
Sum of even numbers : 0 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 16 + 18 = 90
Odd numbers in the range : 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17
Sum of odd numbers : 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17 = 81
THus, SUM(Even) > SUM(Odd)
Output :
2 4 6 8 10
12 14 16 18

INVALID RANGE
Explanation 2

Given range is invalid.
Thus output : INVALID RANGE
